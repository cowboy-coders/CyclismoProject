JFormica is an ANT+ library for java. It is designed to take some of strain away from writing ant enabled applications.

Compatability: 

Ant+ usb stick - all operating systems with an javax.usb implementation / Android (using the wrapper for dynastream's antlib)
Ant+ enabled phone - Android only

It is based on python-ant (https://github.com/mvillalba/python-ant) by Martín Raúl Villalba.

EXAMPLE CODE:

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS:

To compile either import each folder into eclipse or compile using gradle.

General notes

jsr80: you should copy a jar containing a javax.usb implementation to jformica_jsr80/libs/jsr80
android - you need to copy dynastreams antlib.jar to jformica_android/libs
 
Gradle notes

To compile seperately, enter the desired compoents folder and issue 'gradle build'. Doing so from the project root will attempt to build all three. Add the resulting jars to your classpath.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
