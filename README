clean all projects and rebuild

I've included a linux x86_64 javax usb implementation. You may need to recompile/ use an alternative implementation.

Set environmental vars:
ANDROID_SDK - location to your android sdk platforms directory eg /home/will/android-sdks/platforms
CYCLISMO_ROOT - location of CyclismoProject git repo (or workspace if you copied directories)

Build in eclipse
